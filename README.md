## Purpose
This project has been created to create a game of TicTacToe for two players.
It also has a time travel feature allowing the users to go back any number of moves that game.
It runs the same as my TicTacToe game other than this was created for use with gatsby.

## Setup
To run this project, after downlaoding, navigate to the file and use the "gatsby develop" comand.
In your web browser of choice enter "http://localhost:8000/" and a 3x3 board will be displayed that accepts clicks to place either an 'X' or an 'O' in the spot.
The time control mechanic allows the player to go back in time just by pressing the corresponding button.

## Tests
The testing has a wide range of different tests. Including making sure that a click is regestered, making sure that either player can win in either direction, and making sure that the board starts empty.
