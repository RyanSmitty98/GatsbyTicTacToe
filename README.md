## Purpose
This project has been created to create a game of TicTacToe for two players.
It also has a time travel feature allowing the users to go back any number of moves that game.
It runs the same as my TicTacToe game other than this was created for use with gatsby.

## Setup
To run this project, after downlaoding, navigate to the file and use the "gatsby develop" comand.
It will open up a local host window in your web browser of choice, will render a 3x3 tic-tac-toe board and allow for two players to play it.
